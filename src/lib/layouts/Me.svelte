        <p>Hi, there! I've been a web programmer for a few years. I know the basics of back-end but my focus is the front-end part of applications. Much of what I learned was from forums, online courses and the experience of getting my hands dirty.</p>
        <p>However, I have already studied 'Systems Development' at ETEC Devisate (2022-2023), and am currently studying 'Computer Science' at Unimar (both brazilian institutions).</p>
        <p>This is an area that I genuinely like, I don't do it because it's 'trend', this reason contributes to the fact that I wanna deliver the best work, so people like you have a good experience in transforming ideas into reality.</p>
