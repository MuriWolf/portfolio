An application to tell more about what I know and what I did.</br> Not much different from all these portfolios out there, it's simple but elegant.</br> All design and **programming** made by me.
# What was used
For the newest version, the techs used was:
- Svelte/kit
- Tailwind
- Typescript
- CSS
- Figma (for design)
- Linux (ambient)
